\begin{quote}
Patterns are the result of several years of deep study in the research
field of Workflow System. It is important to describe what patterns are supported
by \em{ruote} and how this is achieved, because this enables users to write their 
workflow schemas using ideas already consolidated and theory proven, and avoiding
to spend too much effort in describing already known situations.
