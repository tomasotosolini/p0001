\section{What is Ruote?}

Ruote is an Open source WorkFlow Environment / Engine written in Ruby, 
originating from the OpenWFE Open source Wokflow Enviroment which in written in Java.

OpenWFE is about running business processes, with participants being either 
humans (workflow) either other services.

OpenWFE was founded in 2001. The initial concept was to build it on top of an EJB container and a JMS system. It was registered on Sourceforge.net on the 29th of May 2002.

OpenWFE's name is inspired by the many Open + 3 letters project names, with, as the main example, OpenBSD, the open source operating system.

This software is available under a BSD license, meaning the only barrier to using it is a sufficient skill level. OpenWFE has always sported a BSD license, and it will always do.

The process definition language that OpenWFE uses is meant to be straightforward and no nonsense.
